I found [an interesting B.S. thesis on an application of the Grover algorithm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MGDwvLDmRqS-57M6gw__xVqpPEKokHqP/view).

Starting from the results and a few images of the circuits, I was able to write the code to reproduce them and get compatible results with different data (`grover_thesis.ipynb`).
